**Azeez Ali** *[00:05]*: What up? Sup? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:08]*: I gotta find my charger. One sec. 
**Azeez Ali** *[00:10]*: No worries. Hello? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:22]*: Hey, how's it going, Jacob? 
**Azeez Ali** *[00:24]*: I'm doing good. How you doing today? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:26]*: Doing good. Thank you for that. That loom that you sent over. I'm not sure. In all honesty, I'm not sure where. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:33]*: This 500 area is coming from. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:34]*: And last I tested, you know, things were. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:37]*: Things were going good. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:37]*: But obviously I'll be diving into this, you know, shortly after this call just. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:41]*: To see exactly what's going on. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:43]*: But thank you for sending that over. I appreciate that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[00:47]*: Oh, okay. Yeah, you will come. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[00:50]*: So we. 
**Azeez Ali** *[00:51]*: And we. Yeah, I was just saying, like, can we go into, like, an overview of the whole project and. Because I have, like, a couple of questions and a couple of things I would like to understand. Okay. 
**Azeez Ali** *[01:08]*: Yeah. 
**Azeez Ali** *[01:09]*: Hello, Leonardo. I see, like, we have one new person here, so. Never say that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[01:13]*: Hello. 
**Azeez Ali** *[01:14]*: Nice to meet you. So, yeah, I'm joining in as a new technical consultant. I'm getting on the loop on the project so that I can provide support moving forward. So, yeah, nice to meet. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[01:25]*: All right. 
**Azeez Ali** *[01:26]*: One second, please. Let me. Yeah, sorry about that. So, yeah, I just wanted to like, you know, get like a quick overview of. Of the. The whole project, you know, for the cargo. Credible as a whole. Because right now it's. It's not where I expected it to be. Like, honestly. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[02:17]*: Of course. 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:18]*: And I don't know, I'm actually not very happy about it, just to be honest. 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:25]*: Can we. 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:26]*: Can you pull up the scope? I know, like, we've been trying to like, get this. We started this back in April is incorrect. And then June was when the whole thing actually started. 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:36]*: So can we go back? 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:37]*: Can you pull up the scope of the project from the beginning? Like when? 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:42]*: Before? 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:44]*: Yeah, you got it. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[02:46]*: Just one sec. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[02:47]*: See if I can find that for you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[02:49]*: Thank you. See here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[02:52]*: But no, I totally understand. You know, I. I kind of started from, you know, a couple feedback on this project. As you know, we had no DEB here at the start of this. And so, you know, some things kind of fell through right in the middle of. Of what we had going on with this project. So I understand that, you know, we're. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[03:10]*: Not exactly where we should be right now. Let me see if I can find. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[03:13]*: The scope for you and we'll go through that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[03:15]*: Okay. See here? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[03:23]*: This looks about right. Let me pull this up. 
**Azeez Ali** *[03:27]*: I think it's about like in four or five months. 
**Azeez Ali** *[03:32]*: Yeah. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[03:33]*: Oh, you know what? Yeah. So this is. This is an MVP feature list. I think I want to say your Original quote was for, I want to say five months. Sounds about right. Maybe four months. 
**Azeez Ali** *[03:44]*: Yeah, I think it's four or five months. Yeah. Four, five months. Yeah, got it. I understand. I'm not even kind of like talking about the timing right now. 
**Azeez Ali** *[03:53]*: I just want like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[03:54]*: Even though we took that much time, I understood what happened. Like you just have to like step in when no debate left and nobody knew what's going on with it. And then you have to like step. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:04]*: In and continue the project. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:05]*: But even at that like you know, Richard was there and he understood the project. Right. You know, so it started with Richard. He understood the project from ground up and then it was passed to Node Bay. Okay. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:17]*: Not a bay. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:18]*: Took a little bit of time, but he started getting hold of it and. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:20]*: Understanding what needs to be done. And at the point when he really. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:23]*: Understood because it's not like it's a very specific stuff, right? Yeah. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:28]*: By the time he got hold of. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:29]*: It, that was when like he left. And then you came in and you know, now like another person is going. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:36]*: To get hold of it and for the person to start understanding what's going. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:39]*: On, that's going to take a little bit of time too. You know. And we've not even gotten like, you know the stuff. The main functionality of the. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:50]*: That needs to be doing. We still don't have it here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:53]*: So like if you go back to the, to the scope the one we had because there was one. 
**Azeez Ali** *[04:57]*: Scope when they built cargo credible originally that was when were getting data from carrier. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:01]*: Okay. Then the second scope was the one we did and then we started have to like work with the. Creating the pipeline. That's the one. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:08]*: If you have that, you please pull. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:10]*: That up because there are a couple. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:12]*: Of things that were actually in there. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:14]*: And I just want to like, you know, make sure. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[05:19]*: So this should be what you're looking for. This is your quote here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[05:23]*: So we'll go down. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[05:24]*: This has the monthly breakdown that I. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[05:25]*: Think you're looking for. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:27]*: Yeah. FMCSA Data Pipeline Database Architecture and Design. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:30]*: Historical Data Processing Company Census Integration Data. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:35]*: Quality and Validation System. Yeah, I don't think any of this. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:39]*: Is working right now. If we go down then we say Company Profile System Carrier Operation Details Implements Carrier Specific Information Driver Information Display System. Present Driver information da da da. 
**Azeez Ali** *[05:54]*: Equipment Information Search Builder functionality. I don't think we have any of this either. Insurance Industry management. That should be already like if the pipeline is built it should be able. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:05]*: To who that information Insurance requirement Display revocation history Safety ratings and review and. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:13]*: Accident data and platform deployment. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:15]*: And the main reason why we need. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:16]*: This is for like, you know, for. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:17]*: The insurance company to be able to like, you know, check the historical insurance information. Also for us to know, like, if. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:24]*: When did the revocation happen and all. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:26]*: That information and also if there's going. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:27]*: To be any kind of data or accident and whatever like that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:30]*: So that down the line, what we're. 
**Azeez Ali** *[06:32]*: Going to do is like, because we have that historical data, we can actually match information from NHSA based on recalls, based on damages, based on historical, like, information. We can match it to this and we can know, like, where all this, where that VIN number has been, the number of companies it has been. And that's going to help us create the. What is it called? Related companies. Because that VIN number is just one VIN number. I can sell my truck to another person or I can move my truck from one company to another company. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:02]*: Those companies should all be related by that VIN number. And how are we going to do that? 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:08]*: We're going to do that from the. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:09]*: Historical history of the, of whatever we have. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:13]*: Ever since FMCS has been keeping that history. We need to keep the history of that stuff. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:18]*: And then month four is like bug fixing, like. Yeah, I understand that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:22]*: And I think if you scroll down. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:24]*: A little bit more. Is there any other thing? Okay, these are just. Yeah, you know, and then we did. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:32]*: Talk about like, the security and compliance. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:35]*: And, you know, all that stuff. And let's see. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:39]*: Vehicle inspection violation, linking system alternative. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:45]*: Okay, all these ones are not something that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[07:47]*: Yeah, so that's all just propose. 
**Azeez Ali** *[07:50]*: But like, if you check the video that I sent to you're going to see if you scroll up the, the pipeline. I don't think the pipeline is working. 
**Azeez Ali** *[08:01]*: I don't think it's functional. 
**Azeez Ali** *[08:04]*: Why? Because it's not searching based on the MC number. It's not searching based on the DOT number. It's not finding companies that are like, legit working. They've been like, working for like 10 years. I should be able to like put in the MC number and that company should come up. And when it comes up, I should be able to like, look into that company and then I should find all the information about that company. I should be able to like scroll back, let's say five years. I want to see what the historical data is. I should be able to like, see that, but I can't see any of that information here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[08:34]*: You know. 
**Azeez Ali** *[08:37]*: I don't know, like, why and how this the pipeline was built, but the idea was the API. If we plugged in an API, it was not going to function properly because that was what I got when I spoke to the FMCSA and also when we tested it, the best way to do it. And I've seen like, you know, some. 
**Azeez Ali** *[08:57]*: Other, like, should I say other guys. 
**Azeez Ali** *[08:59]*: That are actually already running like something like this, like a business like this do it. They actually capture every day. The FMCSA releases information every day. I think like in the morning, 8 o' clock Eastern time, they download that data in CSV. That's when they get about like 4 million all the data that is actually. And the new, then they import it into their own data and they actually process it. And whatever is new is actually going to be flagged out as new information. That these are the people that are just registered today that are just like updated. That kind of information is what we want to give to like insurance companies give to compliance companies give to, should I say safety companies because they are interested in the new guys so they. 
**Azeez Ali** *[09:43]*: Can offer their business to them. You get what I'm saying? 
**Azeez Ali** *[09:46]*: So like that's why we needed to like build the, the pipeline and get all that information. And also we want to keep that historical record in our system and also the historical record that the FMCSD have so that by the time like we start growing, we're going to start analyzing this data and then we start seeing like for example, I analyzed a little. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:03]*: Bit of data based on some history I got. You'll be able to like see that we have like more accidents like in. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:10]*: This state and this state. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:12]*: And that's going to be in summer, but in winter you actually have less accidents. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:16]*: And all this data is something that is actually needed that I want to. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:20]*: Use to now fool the algorithm that we are building for the freight calculator. Because once you want to know which state is safe to go so you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:28]*: Can actually charge based on that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:30]*: And I don't think the data pipeline. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:33]*: Is working like that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:34]*: Like I don't think the database is working like that. You know, we need to like get all that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:39]*: That's why I'm like, I want to. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:40]*: See what the data pipeline is like and what we actually working with, you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:47]*: Know, because if it's just an API. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:48]*: It'S not going to do the job. And that's what I'm seeing right now. Like you're punching like some MC numbers. I did a couple of MC numbers. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:55]*: Before, I just tried with that one. 
**Azeez Ali** *[10:57]*: So like in the video, it's not coming up. Even the company that has ratings within. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:03]*: What is it called? That has written within Cargo. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:05]*: Credible, for example, offmax. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:07]*: I put in the MC number. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:08]*: It's not popping up. It's just. And it takes like a long time. I understand. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:15]*: Like it's a lot of data. But how did every other platform do it, whereby you punch in the name, you punch in the MC number and immediately the stuff comes up. Like why that's something that was supposed. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:26]*: To be fixed, you know, after the very first build, that was a very. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:30]*: Big issue and that was something that was supposed to be fixed on this because the goal was like you build your own data pipeline and once you do that situation is going to be gone. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:38]*: Because it's just once you prompt it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:40]*: It knows exactly where it's prompting in database and it's just giving you the results immediately. So you call in the information, it's giving you the information that you need. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:47]*: Like in, you know, microseconds. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:49]*: That, that one is not done. 
**Azeez Ali** *[11:51]*: You know, and we still stuck with the very first data infrastructure and database. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[11:59]*: Yep. So I'm going to be honest with. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:01]*: You about a whole lot of things. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:03]*: First of all, this project was terribly scoped, terribly quoted. This should have been probably closer to about $35,000 easily, especially if we're talking. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:13]*: About having an own custom data pipeline, having an own custom, you know, historical. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:17]*: Processing, things like that. So I just wanted to lay that out. You know, this is a very. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:25]*: Very complex application, as I'm sure you're aware. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:27]*: Now, as for the data pipeline that is currently had. So what currently happens is that every morning at about 3am FMCSA is scraped for all its new data and this. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:38]*: Is ported right into MongoDB. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:40]*: That's why I had you set that up. That's from what I could see, that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:44]*: Was the original intent was to have. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[12:47]*: MongoDB and then have the rating and the user authentication through postgres. As far as I was concerned, you know, before noon today, that was all working appropriately. But obviously we have some errors in there, things like that. So here's what we can do here. First of all, I do want to ask about these historical files. No idea what these are. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[13:09]*: Are these, are these something I'm supposed to have? Are these something that are important to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[13:13]*: This development pipeline here? Because if so, I don't have them. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[13:17]*: So currently all the information is coming directly from fmcsa. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[13:20]*: And if that's not appropriate, then, you. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[13:23]*: Know, that's something we can talk about. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[13:24]*: But I don't see any other way that you're supposed to be getting this data from fmcsa. So if I'm missing something for my development purposes, please, by all means, let me know so we can rectify that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[13:37]*: Okay, so like on the FMCSA, when you log in, there is a place where you can actually get historical data. I remember like I did send a lot of this information back then to Richard also. 
**Azeez Ali** *[13:56]*: I don't know if I did send. 
**Azeez Ali** *[13:57]*: To you, but I think I did send you some FMCSA like dot links where you can actually get this information. But that's like in the past. Let me do this. I'm going to come here to the meeting right here and I'm going to share my screen. Let me share my screen real quick. 
**Azeez Ali** *[14:22]*: Share my old window. 
**Azeez Ali** *[14:24]*: So you can see everything. Yeah. Can you see this? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[14:35]*: Yep. 
**Azeez Ali** *[14:35]*: So this is where what we supposed to be doing is. So for example, let me just come back here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[14:50]*: So this is where they have all. 
**Azeez Ali** *[14:51]*: The database, everything, the historical database is also here. Right. I'm just going to come here and I'm going to come here for data sets. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:09]*: Come back to home. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:13]*: Working on the mother coach. Okay, let me come into data set. So here, this company consensus file, right? This is where like all the information. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:28]*: About the company actually is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:30]*: And it's going to be found through. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:32]*: A unique identifier which is going to. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:33]*: Be the USDOT inspection per unit. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:36]*: This is where all the inspection comes. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:37]*: In, all the inspection that was done. So we can come here to like inspection per unit and we can actually check the information where this is where. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:48]*: The data is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[15:50]*: Right? All the data is going to be here. And what we supposed to do is like every day we should have something that's going to come here, export this information into our database and then we. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:03]*: Keep it for that day. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:04]*: And then we now manipulate that data in our own system. So you can see here, you have the inspection id. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:10]*: This was the inspection that was done. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:12]*: On the, on the truck. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:13]*: You have the unit number, you have. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:15]*: The inspection, the unit to make, you have the license plate, you have the issuing states, you have the VIN number of that vehicle that was inspected and all that is actually going to go. And on the inspection id. If we're going to be like, you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:32]*: Know, looking into the inspection id when. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:33]*: We go to the, Let me go. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:36]*: To like another data based on the inspection id, you're going to find exactly. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:39]*: What kind of inspection was actually done and what exactly. How am I supposed to put it. What exactly did the officer say on that? Here it's already giving us like the, what the stuff mean? 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:53]*: Inspection date and every other thing like that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[16:56]*: You know, let me come here. This was inspection. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[17:00]*: So every day before you continue. So previously we've talked about, we had talked about this site. I'm fairly certain we had mentioned using the API. I was under no impression that we. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[17:12]*: Were supposed to be exporting and importing files into our own database. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[17:14]*: So that is 100% where our disconnect is coming from. This makes infinitely more sense doing it this way. 
**Azeez Ali** *[17:23]*: Yeah, because the thing is. So for example, this is courier with all history. So this is where the historical data is. So what we supposed to be doing every day. 
**Azeez Ali** *[17:32]*: Because when you said, I remember when you said like oh, you found the API and then the API works, you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[17:36]*: Know, I did mention that I did like the API gives limited information because. 
**Azeez Ali** *[17:42]*: I know that I spoke to them. 
**Azeez Ali** *[17:44]*: At the DOT office and at the fmcsa. It gives very limited information. 
**Azeez Ali** *[17:48]*: The only place you can find full. 
**Azeez Ali** *[17:49]*: Flat information is going to be if you use these data sets that has been provided and it's been updated every day. If you want to find like historical data, this is the historical data. This is all history of everything that has been like, you know, with all the model carrier, if you come here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:07]*: You'Re going to find like a whole lot of information. You have the MC number, the DOT number. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:12]*: If it's a broker or if it's. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:14]*: A carrier, you have like pretty much. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:16]*: All the information. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:18]*: Their insurance you find like if they have like a DBA. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:22]*: Name, their history, when they actually started. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:25]*: Like all that information is actually right. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:27]*: Here in the historical and it keeps. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:29]*: It from the very first time that he actually started still the, what. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:34]*: Is it called till date. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:37]*: Like do they have like a revocation. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:39]*: Pending and all that stuff? 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:41]*: This is where we actually get it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:42]*: And we have to like match it to that information. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:45]*: So like when we come here, this. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:46]*: Is where we see like the carrier information. Let's say we want to get all. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:52]*: The inspection, we get it here, all the crashes that happens, you know, from. 
**Azeez Ali** *[18:57]*: All the states, it's going to be recorded here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:00]*: SMS INPUT crash. So this is where it now gets very interesting. So like when they say SMS input, this one is updated once a month, right? And then the data set is actually telling us like what kind of information. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:12]*: Is actually there in the crash in the dot. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:15]*: This is going to be mapped to the dot number. The dot number is always going to. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:19]*: Be our Unique identifier for anything, if you understand what I'm saying. So you see like this one is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:23]*: Updated like every month. Why? Because they calculated based on the weight. There is a weight calculation system that they use to actually score every company. And because of that, they do that every month. So all the violations, all the inspections that you get, if it's good, if it's bad, you get a point for that. And it's been calculated into your company's stuff. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:45]*: So like this one is going to be once a month and you can. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:47]*: See like people are coming here and they are downloading it. These are people that download automatically on a daily basis. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:55]*: You understand? Even the one that's. 
**Azeez Ali** *[19:57]*: Let's see, something that got uploaded, inspections today it has 50,000 views. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:02]*: And let's see how many downloads, like 16,000 downloads. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:06]*: Because people come here and they download this information every day. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:09]*: But we are building a data pipeline. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:11]*: Whereby we don't have to do this every day. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:12]*: The system is supposed to come here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:14]*: And every day download like export this every day. The API endpoint, it's not going to work properly because it's going to have. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:22]*: Like limited data. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:26]*: It's better to just download the file in CSV, import it into our system. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:30]*: And then we now manipulate it from there. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:33]*: That was what we've been talking like, you know, from the day one. Because at first we couldn't get this information and the day I actually got. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:38]*: It, I remember talking to Richard and. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:40]*: I told him, like, this is what we need and this. And it's like, oh, this is going. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:43]*: To make it way much easier. And you know, working with Node, then. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:47]*: The goal was like, we know where the information is, we know where the data is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:51]*: We're going to write a pipeline whereby. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:53]*: We come in here, we import all this data one after the other. Then it's going to create like a. 
**Azeez Ali** *[20:59]*: Master, I don't know whatever that is, a spreadsheet. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:02]*: I'm thinking in form of spreadsheet. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:03]*: It's going to create like a master. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:04]*: Spreadsheet where all this information is now going to go. Then from there we can now manipulate. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:10]*: The, the data based on filters, you understand. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:14]*: So our main goal is like get all this information that is needed here. We understand what the information is. We need to understand it obviously put it into the database based on that. We're going to map it based on the dot number because that's going to be our unique identifier for all the companies. And then the US dot number is always accomplished. Accompanied by a MC number, right? Not everybody have an MC number, but everybody has a DOT number. And because of that we're going to know the company name, we're going to know what the insurance is, we're going to all that information. And our goal is to be able. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:46]*: To like present this to the user. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:48]*: That is going to be able to. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:49]*: Use it in a very easy way. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:52]*: So I'm going to show you something. 
**Azeez Ali** *[21:53]*: Real quick right here so you can get like better understanding of what I'm saying. Okay, so you can see I'm logged in here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:13]*: If I put in this company, I searched it, you see how fast that was? 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:17]*: Like nanoseconds, right? 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:19]*: And then this is the company I need. I click on this company, it gives me all the information about this company. 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:26]*: See, we have the address, we have the contact info, the email, the person. 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:32]*: That registered it first, the emails and. 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:34]*: Every other thing there. And we see the history since when. 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:36]*: It was started, since 2016 till 2025. That comes from the historical data. 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:41]*: We know like their dot status, like everything here, their MC number, their dot number. 
**Azeez Ali** *[22:47]*: We see like they have been active for 10 years and they actually started this time for 2016. So that's like 10 years they've been operating. We see the kind of freights, they haul everything here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:00]*: We see the number of drivers that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:02]*: They have, total number of trucks, total number of power units, the fleet size code. We see the number of tractors and the ones that is owned and the ones that is leased, because that information is also given to us. We see the trailer owned, the trailer leased. We see the total miles that they filed in 2024. Sorry, yeah, the miles filed in 2025, the total miles that they drove that year when they updated their MCS150. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:26]*: That gives us the mileage. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:27]*: And this is also like a very. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:28]*: Good thing that we're going to be tracking. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:30]*: Then we see here what their insurance is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:32]*: We see what their insurance carrier is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:35]*: We see their policy number. We see the date was posted. We see the coverage and effective date. If they cancel it, we see the cancellation. The Secretary of State. Well, we don't have that yet. That's something we need to like input later on. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:49]*: But that's fine. They, they inputted like the Secretary of State. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:52]*: Now we know like, okay, this is where they are registered and this is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:55]*: A valid company under the Secretary of State. 
**Azeez Ali** *[23:58]*: Now we can see like related companies. How did we know these companies are related? 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:03]*: 1, by the VIN numbers. 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:05]*: It shows like they have like 22. 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:06]*: VIN numbers together with Empire Expedite the city we see like also they have like nine also related to Polk, right? Another thing we see like okay, because. 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:18]*: Of the city and the address they. 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:20]*: Might be related here. So we like plugged all this here and then we see one is like one VIN number. 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:25]*: What might happen is like possibly they bought this truck from these guys at a point in time and now the truck is with them. So me as a broker that I want to work with them, I'm going to know like these people are kind of related to Empire Expedited. They are not even hiding it and they are Polk Express. So it's like three different companies that they're running. 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:43]*: But it's fine to still work with. 
**Azeez Ali** *[24:45]*: Them because they have like a relatively good safety score, right? You see it shows like an insight here. The company has an active registration with Secretary of State. The company is added to FMCSA 10 years ago. The company maintain active duty D d d 29 inspection. In 2025 the company was held common authority for 10 years. All this is registered with California Resource. 12% of the vehicle out of service. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:07]*: We have all this information now if. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:09]*: You come here, these guys, they also have like reviews and whatever like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:13]*: That people use it. This guy has been like old. You can see like if they have like any reviews it's going to be here. Sms. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:21]*: This is where the information comes. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:23]*: You want to see what the SMS is? You can see number of vehicles, number. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:27]*: Of drivers, total inspection143. Over the years they've been existing total inspection of violations. The total violations they had total inspection without violation, with violation, total crashes. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:39]*: And then you can see like you know the safety rate in their vehicle. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:42]*: Is 12.5, driver 0.7, half month is zero. And then you can see what they. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:46]*: Are actually allows to carry. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:48]*: And then yeah, you see on safe driving the basic score, this information is also there. You see how it's coming down. It means they are working with this, they are a safe company. If I come here to crash indicators. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:58]*: I'm going to see here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[25:59]*: If I come here to hours of service, you see how the hours of service has improved. If I come here to vehicle maintenance, you see they need to like work. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:06]*: On vehicle maintenance, alcohol substance, it's like same all this while. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:10]*: Like it doesn't change. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:11]*: Hazardous material, driver fitness, you know this is already going down. This is good. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:17]*: Now I as a company I want. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:19]*: To work with them. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:19]*: This is like important information for me. And those are the things that we need to have on. On cargo credible. And where can we get that information? We get it from this fmcsa. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:27]*: This guy gets it from fmcsa. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:29]*: All the inspection results is here. And because he has all this information, he can now actually come here to the inspection. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:36]*: Now what I'm saying, like for this. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:37]*: Inspection, you see the VIN number. If I click on this power unit, I'm going to see exactly how many inspection has been done on that stuff. And then I can click on the report. I'm going to see exactly what the report is, the license. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:51]*: And here I can actually go in. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:53]*: There and just drill down and understand. 
**Azeez Ali** *[26:56]*: What'S exactly, what exactly happened on that, what is it called on that specific truck or company or what kind of violation they actually have. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:05]*: So this is the inspection I can come back as 2018 and get all the information on the inspections. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:12]*: You understand what I'm saying? And that thing is like, I can see like the inspection map. The inspection map tells me how they write. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:20]*: Where are the places that these people go? 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:23]*: Because they actually have the inspection and. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:24]*: Every other thing there. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:25]*: I see they go to California a. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:27]*: Lot and North Carolina. These are the places they actually really do visit. And that's true. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:31]*: The company runs North Carolina to California. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:34]*: I handle the operation for more than. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:37]*: Two years or so. You know, North Carolina, so California. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:42]*: And you can see it reflects based. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:43]*: On the number of operations. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:44]*: This is where we do drive. So it's very natural for us to. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:47]*: Get inspections around all these places. 
**Azeez Ali** *[27:49]*: We do pickups around all these places. And now we start running Illinois and you can see like, because of that we start getting inspection in all these areas too. So it's very. It's just like to give like an insight. And then accidents, did they have any accidents? We can drill back as back at only God knows when, 2017. 
**Azeez Ali** *[28:07]*: And you're going to see like, you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[28:08]*: Know, all the accidents that they actually had. This is exactly what we're trying to like just do, but just to make. 
**Azeez Ali** *[28:16]*: It like in a better way and make it more, should I say, way better than what we have right now. Plus it's going to be like a review system. 
**Azeez Ali** *[28:28]*: I don't know if everything I've said. 
**Azeez Ali** *[28:30]*: You understand everything I'm saying. Yeah, yeah. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[28:35]*: The only thing honestly that I'm interested in here is which data you need from this website just so I can start gathering that and building out that pipeline. Do you want all those things that you have listed there? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[28:49]*: Every single one of these? Let's see Here what we have. I'm on the website myself, but if you wanted to reopen it, that'd probably be a little easier. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[28:57]*: So we can walk through it. The transportation.gov website. Oh, okay. Yep. Okay. So these, so these data sets are you looking for all of these data sets to be put in to like that are going to be in the data pipeline? I just want to make sure. Yes, we're straight up that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:15]*: Okay, all right. Sounds for us to get. For us to get everything we need. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:20]*: And to be able to like get the information we need. We need to have all this information and then map it out in our own data pipeline and then we filter it because so for example, everything here does a specific job. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:33]*: That's the thing and that's the way. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:34]*: The FMCA does it. Because some people, they might just need. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:37]*: Out of service and they don't need every other information. Right. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:40]*: So the FMCAC now kind of like broke everything down. Company consensus out of service. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:45]*: This one is going to show us. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:46]*: All the companies that were out of. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:47]*: Service within a specific time. You know, inspection and citation. 
**Azeez Ali** *[29:51]*: How many of them got inspection and citation on a daily basis. Vehicle inspection, the inspection that was done on a daily basis. Violations also inspection per unit on a daily basis. Crash files on a daily basis. The history is updated on a daily basis. This one is updated once a month. This one is updated once a month. This one is updated once a month. Violation SMS inputs. The calculation is updated once a month. Special studies. This one is updated. We're gonna need it, but it's not. 
**Azeez Ali** *[30:18]*: Like very like important. Insurance of insurance. 
**Azeez Ali** *[30:23]*: History with all history is needed. Revocation with all history needed. Insurance with all history is needed. Rejected. These are the people that want to like come in, but they were rejected. 
**Azeez Ali** *[30:31]*: Needed. 
**Azeez Ali** *[30:32]*: Active pending insurance. That's when you like update your insurance, but it's still waiting for FMCSA to update it. This one is needed. So we need to like collate all. 
**Azeez Ali** *[30:40]*: This data one after the other and then every morning we need to like download them, make sure it's actually updated. 
**Azeez Ali** *[30:49]*: And then we map it into our own data set. So if we do that then we can get like a more robust information. 
**Azeez Ali** *[30:57]*: That is going to be used. 
**Azeez Ali** *[31:01]*: Okay. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:02]*: So, okay, I have my requirements. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:05]*: So basically how this is going to work is I'm going to take all. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:08]*: Of these different files. I'm going to build mappers for each of them in cargo. Credible. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:14]*: I have no clue if any of. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:15]*: These are built out currently. I could not tell you. This app was built as A mess. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:19]*: From the get go. And so it has taken a lot of time to. Obviously it's not working right now for. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:26]*: Whatever reason, but it's taken a lot of effort and a lot of time to get it to, you know, any. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:31]*: Sort of point, especially considering security vulnerabilities, things like that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:36]*: So I'm going to build mappers for each of these and I will have it recurring either monthly or daily, depending on if the information is refreshed monthly or daily. I'll make sure I have that noted in there. And then how that'll work, it'll just map into our. We'll keep the MongoDB database just because. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:53]*: That'S good for information being structured in this way. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[31:56]*: And then rating and user authentication is going to remain on postgres, which is just a different database that we have. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:02]*: Set up for your application here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:05]*: So that's going to be priority number one. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:07]*: Leonardo's going to help out as well. We're going to have a couple of developers on this, you know, assisting us with this. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:13]*: This is priority number one here. You know, this has been rough from the jump. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:17]*: I know it's passed through a lot of different hands here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:20]*: But I hope you know that I am more than committed to making sure that we get this done right now. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:25]*: That I know, you know where the data is coming from. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:27]*: You know, I don't anticipate this being. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:29]*: Difficult whatsoever and I know that again. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:32]*: It'S been kind of rocky to this point, but you know, you've been a great client to this point. I appreciate all the help, all the explanations, things like that, but yeah, we're right on top of this. I want to get working on this right after this call and yeah, thank you for, you know, being as good. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:49]*: Of a client as you are to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[32:50]*: This point and being understanding. We appreciate it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[32:54]*: Yeah, I think you should talk to Richard. 
**Azeez Ali** *[32:57]*: I know like no day started building this data pipeline. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:00]*: I knew 100% because it was true. Whenever he builds something like we talk. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:05]*: About it and it shows me. I knew he already had a process. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:08]*: Of importing all the data. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:10]*: I knew he had already kind of identified, studied and specified what data does. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:16]*: What he did that I knew that he already also like written down like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:22]*: I believe like a document that shows. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:23]*: Like this data is what this is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:25]*: For and this is what this thing. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:27]*: Means and this is where we gonna. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:28]*: Put it and how we're gonna like get each data and which of the. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:32]*: Data we need to get on a daily basis and where it's gonna go. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:36]*: To and where it's gonna go afterwards. 
**Azeez Ali** *[33:38]*: You understand the issue? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[33:41]*: The issue is he built this via Google Cloud that we no longer have access to. So there's no way for me to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[33:48]*: Get any of the information or any. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[33:50]*: Of the development that he had done. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[33:52]*: Because he was in a service that I. It's his own personal service that I. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[33:55]*: Don'T have access to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[33:56]*: And so maybe I do have access. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:00]*: Can you tell me if you do. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:02]*: That, be great what that is? I can. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[34:04]*: I have no idea. All I know, it says through Google Cloud. And that's really all the information that I have, if I'm being quite honest. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:11]*: With you, to Google Clouds that I created, I'm going to like, check them out. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:18]*: And if I check those out for sure, you, I don't know, maybe you'll be able to like, you know, make sense of it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:24]*: But I know because whenever, like it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:26]*: Did that or whatever like that I knew like you already had this design for the. What is it called? Also embedded in there where you can filter information and just kind of like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:39]*: Get information that's like for the insurance. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:41]*: The safety people and whatever like that already has that part also built into it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:48]*: What I'm going to do is I'm. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:50]*: Going to like look into those, those clouds, the one like the Google Cloud, like you said, because I. 
**Azeez Ali** *[34:56]*: Know we created about two or three of those. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:00]*: If I can get hold of it, then I can actually extend that to you and then you'll be able to just kind of like, you know, jump in. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:07]*: But back then I knew like, it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:09]*: Was actually creating all that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:11]*: So what it does like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:13]*: Something creates whatever it is. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:16]*: I'm not a tech guy. And then like, it shows me like, hey, this is what's going on. This is what I'm doing. These are the things that's going on. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:22]*: And this is how this is going to work. Yeah, right. So I kind of like, that's why I can tell you right now, like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:27]*: These are the things I know, like he has done. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:30]*: And this is where, like when he stopped, I was believing, like you guys. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:34]*: Have like an internal folder or internal. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:35]*: File where you share everything so that if the next person is going to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[35:40]*: Some people don't follow the rules and. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[35:41]*: Then things get lost, which is what happened here. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:44]*: If somebody's going to come on board, then somebody else can just, you know, jump on. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:47]*: Because, yeah, we all know anything can happen. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:49]*: People get sick, People go to like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:51]*: A different job or something like that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[35:54]*: We should be able to like, just continue. So yeah, but policies are only good. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[36:00]*: When people follow them, you know. Yeah, unfortunate, but it's the reality we're in. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:06]*: So this is where we stuck right now because the, the this month I already had like a different idea because not different, like different agenda. I believe like the old thing is already going to be working. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:19]*: I should have seen that video earlier. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:21]*: But I just wanted to like just record it and send it over, you know, so that my goal was like I was already going to be working on how should we start doing those stuffs. I was talking about the, the resources so that people can go there. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:37]*: And it's going to be like a. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:38]*: General resource hub for them, you know. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:40]*: All that good stuff. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:42]*: But now we don't even have the. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:44]*: Extra things that is going to attract them because a lot of people do this. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:47]*: You just saw what I showed you right now. That's a very robust, very solid website and it does everything. It's fast, it's way more sophisticated, people. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:57]*: Know exactly about it, people have been. 
**Azeez Ali** *[36:59]*: Using it, everybody uses it. Like it's way better like 10 times, 10 fold than cargo credible right now. And that's for free. Like you don't have to pay a dime for it. Like it's for free 100%. So if we're trying to like you know, sell something, we should be able to give them like an extra level of value which is what we're trying to do. Like everybody can use it for free. 
**Azeez Ali** *[37:21]*: We bring in more eyes over there. 
**Azeez Ali** *[37:23]*: And then you know, the whole structure is like, it's a big agenda if I'm going to put it that way. However, we don't even have the basic structure to actually even pull people in. It's not, it's not working. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[37:37]*: Well. There was just a discrepancy between where. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[37:40]*: Were we getting the data. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[37:40]*: I had no idea that the API was limited by any means. That's going to cause all the issues. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[37:47]*: That we're experiencing right now. So yeah, again what I'll be able. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[37:50]*: To do a lot of what I have currently will be able to retrofit with this style just because between. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[37:57]*: The JSON and the CSV a good amount of the field names are the same from what I'm seeing here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:03]*: So I should be able to retrofit that. I'll keep you updated on that again. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:07]*: As soon as we get off this call. That's what I'm going to be working on. Just making sure that we can switch. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:11]*: Over from the API to the CSVs. And then once I have this data pipeline kind of down pat, I'll let. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:17]*: You know and we can go from there. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:19]*: But I think that'll alleviate a lot. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:20]*: Of the issues, a lot of the slowdowns that you're experiencing. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:23]*: And then once we get that nailed down how it's supposed to before, then we can move on to working on the resources, working on your own admin interface where you can manage whatever you're looking to manage and we should. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:38]*: Be right back on track. 
**Azeez Ali** *[38:40]*: Gotcha. 
**Azeez Ali** *[38:42]*: I don't know when we're passing this project down to you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[38:47]*: I don't know. Did you have a detailed meeting with Richard? 
**Azeez Ali** *[38:50]*: He understands the whole scope. He understands everything because he started from the beginning. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[38:55]*: Yeah, I've talked to him about it a couple times. Quite frankly, he's a whole lot busier than I am. And so, you know, I can. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[39:02]*: I can certainly see about getting in contact with him about it. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[39:05]*: But to this point, you know, outside of. Outside of pulling the data from where we need to pull it from, what more am I not understanding to this point? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[39:16]*: It seems like that's kind of the main. The main source right here is making. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[39:19]*: Sure that we pull in the data appropriately. Am I missing something outside of that? 
**Azeez Ali** *[39:23]*: Yeah. Pulling the data appropriately and mapping it out on cargo. Credible. So it's like visible. You can always use a roadmap for this broker snapshot, you know, like, I. 
**Azeez Ali** *[39:34]*: Know I've mentioned this before, you can. 
**Azeez Ali** *[39:35]*: Always use this as a roadmap so you can understand, like, you know, where this whole thing is actually coming from. Not that we're trying to be like broker snapshot, but we just trained to give people like that information that they. 
**Azeez Ali** *[39:49]*: Need and they can actually go there. 
**Azeez Ali** *[39:50]*: So they can actually review and, you know, get information, you know, that they need. So that's like the very first thing. 
**Azeez Ali** *[39:59]*: And also like, we're going to need. 
**Azeez Ali** *[40:00]*: Data down the line. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[40:02]*: Yeah, yeah, got it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[40:05]*: All right. But we're on top of it. If you can take like just. I think an hour of Richard's time shouldn't be that bad because I know, like, everybody's busy, you're busy, I'm busy. It's a crazy world out there, but, you know, just giving an hour to explain to you, should I say more technically than I. I will. I'm explaining to you from a. From a layman's. Yeah, like, I'm just telling you, like, this is what I want, this is what the user are going to see. But from the Back end. Yeah. You're going to understand it if Richard is going to explain to you because he knows like the technical terms and. 
**Azeez Ali** *[40:36]*: He can explain because I know he. 
**Azeez Ali** *[40:38]*: Understands this, but I don't know why, like he hasn't. Just an hour is going to be like more than enough to actually get you in there. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[40:48]*: Yeah. And now that I know. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[40:50]*: Where to pull the data from, it's. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[40:52]*: Going to be infinitely easier to spin this up. So I'll certainly talk to him about it. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[40:56]*: I'll let them know. Kind of some updates on things. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[40:59]*: Yeah, I don't anticipate any issues with that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:02]*: And again, I'm going to get working. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:03]*: On that as soon as I'm able to hear. 
**Azeez Ali** *[41:07]*: Okay. 
**Azeez Ali** *[41:08]*: And we can talk about the second project right now too. Like, has there been any updates, improvements or something like that? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:19]*: Yeah, I have a full document that I'm going to show you here. Quick feature complete as of this morning. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:26]*: So I'm just working on. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:28]*: I have a nice user interface that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:30]*: I'm mapping across the entire project. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:32]*: So I'll have that done by Friday and we can kind of go through that together. Let me pull this up real quick. All right, so just kind of implemented. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:46]*: Against what we have in the quote here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:48]*: I'll talk about some more extensive things. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:50]*: In terms of what APIs we're using. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:52]*: And things like that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:53]*: But in terms of month one, so. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[41:55]*: User authentication, your onboarding, your vehicle management, your VIN decoder, this has been super useful so far. 
**Azeez Ali** *[42:01]*: Super cool tool. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:03]*: We have Google Maps integration as well as PC Mylar integration. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:06]*: PCMylar is the default just for trucking routes. And then if for whatever reason, PC Mylar falls off the face of the planet, we also have Google Maps to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:17]*: Kind of as a backup for. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:20]*: Not exactly the route but for the distance. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:23]*: Just so we can get a kind of a rough estimate. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:26]*: We do have this full rate engine, so it takes into account all the. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:29]*: Information from these APIs and assigns a multiplier. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:32]*: And so these multipliers we can talk about, they're at the end of this document here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:36]*: These will of course need some adjusting based on the actual industry. It's kind of where you come in. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:42]*: Being able to put in your load details, your specific operating costs. So on your profile you could put in all of your costs that you. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:50]*: Have that are unique to you and. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:52]*: All of those would be brought in when creating calculations for these rates. And then of course the full dashboard. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[42:58]*: So you'll be able to see how. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:00]*: Many calculations you made. Your profit margin and things like that. Your history as well. There's a referral system in there which we talked about having like a reward system almost Quote export. You can export all these quotes via PDF. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:15]*: I do want to have. I'm not sure if you have a logo of any sort, but if we can slap, you know, a logo on. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:19]*: There, I think that would be pretty nice for these PDFs for these quotes. Mobile first, just so if you are on the road you can do this pretty quickly. I think it took me maybe two clicks to get a quote and that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:32]*: Was just entering in. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:35]*: The start and the end destinations and then maybe one. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:39]*: Or two more things and the rest. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:41]*: Of it was either API based or set up in the account already. Then we're still working on testing and deploying. Of course I'm going to go through. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:48]*: The UI again just make sure things are all good. But in terms of all the back. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:52]*: End, we're pretty much set on that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:56]*: Outside of some things that I want. 
**Azeez Ali** *[43:57]*: You to look at here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[43:58]*: But you can read through all this documentation if you so desire. This is the important part here. Toll cost. We have Toll Guru that's super useful. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:09]*: For making sure that all the tools. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:11]*: Are appropriate in there. These are the current adjustments that we have for weather conditions, you know, weather conditions, load types, things like that. I do encourage you to look through these specifically just so you can, you know, in your own time. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:26]*: Just so you could make sure that. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:26]*: They'Re right around where they should be. Overhead allocation, we had talked about already distance, the droughts. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:35]*: We're using PC Mylar with Google Maps. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:37]*: As a fallback and then some other external APIs. So open weather Map for actually making. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:43]*: Sure the weather, you know, is appropriate. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:45]*: Across the entire route. You know, if there are any issues with that'll be flagged appropriately. Fuel service. So real time prices for fuel. We talked about Toll Guru already. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:56]*: Our VIN service for vehicle decoding is working appropriately. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[44:59]*: And then we also have FMCSA for carrier verification if need be. And then the rest of these again. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[45:07]*: Is with more, some more technical things. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[45:09]*: If you want to go down and scroll through this. But the AI or the APIs rather. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[45:14]*: Is really what I wanted to go through already. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[45:16]*: So the only things, there are some recommendations kind of at the bottom here. So in terms of rate trends to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[45:25]*: Being able to have historical analysis, I think some of that will probably come. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[45:27]*: From cargo credible profit margin alerts. So if margins fall below, let me. 
**Azeez Ali** *[45:34]*: The rate strength dashboard, the analysis, that's where I was talking about scraping the information from DAT and Truck Stop and select us and we keep them in our database. 
**Azeez Ali** *[45:47]*: I'm still talking to Sonar. 
**Azeez Ali** *[45:49]*: They do have historical data also. 
**Azeez Ali** *[45:54]*: I think Gat they have a place I can buy also historical data that. 
**Azeez Ali** *[45:58]*: We can load for a start. 
**Azeez Ali** *[45:59]*: And Truck Stop is still kind of. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:02]*: Shaky if they will give us that historical data or not. But we need to like get some form of data to feed the system and then every other information we need to just scrape on a daily basis. Like it's not even on a daily basis. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:16]*: The scraping should work in such a. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:17]*: Way whereby like I remember like I. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:20]*: Was showing you, like some loads are. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:21]*: There for just seconds. They are just there for seconds. You know, some of them can be there for a while, but usually it's. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:28]*: Like there for like very good loads. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:29]*: They are there for like seconds, you know, on all those platforms. So we want to kind of like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:34]*: You know, script that information, keep them. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:36]*: And those are going to be the. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:37]*: Information that's going to be swelling. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:38]*: The, the red train, the rates trend on the, on the dashboard, the market hits. Sorry, what is it called? 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:47]*: The profit margin. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:48]*: That's mathematics, right? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[46:50]*: Yep. Yeah. 
**Azeez Ali** *[46:52]*: Okay. Yeah. I just wanted to like, you know, make that one clear for the rate trend for sure. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[46:58]*: Yeah, that makes total sense. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[47:01]*: Multisock routing seems to be important. That's one thing that I thought about. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[47:07]*: If it's not important, by all means. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[47:09]*: Not something we have to look into. Load board integration would be. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:14]*: That's part of the stuff because I. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:16]*: Remember like if you check the stuff like I sent to you, I did send you like two magic pardons. And there is one, the very first. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:24]*: One, but the second one has the. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:26]*: Multiple stop because sometimes not sometimes like. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:28]*: A lot of times you picking up. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:30]*: A load from point A and then. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:32]*: You pick up another one point B and you deliver to point C and then point D. So you need to. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:37]*: Be able to like that. It's like routes. You need to get that route. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:40]*: It's part of. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:40]*: It's one run, it's one load. But you're actually having. It's called let's say two peaks, one stop, two peaks, three stops, two peaks. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:48]*: Or one peak, four drops, one peak, five drops. It happens a lot especially like in. 
**Azeez Ali** *[47:52]*: The eastern part of the country where you have like Maine and then you're picking up, let's say fish in the refrigerator. It's going to be like one peak. 
**Azeez Ali** *[48:01]*: And then you can have multiple stops. Sometimes you can have up to 16. 
**Azeez Ali** *[48:04]*: Stops because you're delivering fresh produce all over, you know, or people that pick up, I don't know, cups in refrigerators. Right. You can have multiple stops too. So it's, it's 100% part of what needs to be, should I say. 
**Azeez Ali** *[48:21]*: From the start, from the get go. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:23]*: Okay, got it. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:26]*: A couple other things. So email and SMS notifications. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:30]*: In terms. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:30]*: Of, you know, booking confirmations and things. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:33]*: Like that, currently non committed and then anything to do with, you know, rate recommendations with AI, any sort of predictions with few market with the fuel markets. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:44]*: Maintenance, scheduling, things like that. Obviously all that is, all that's very. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:47]*: Very advanced in here. But in terms of the MVP and. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:51]*: What we've talked about to this point. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:53]*: Aside from obviously what you've brought up so far, we're looking pretty good. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[48:57]*: So again I just want to kind of touch up a couple of things visually and then I'll be able to shoot that link over to you and. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[49:01]*: We should be all set. 
**Azeez Ali** *[49:03]*: Is there a place where I can. 
**Azeez Ali** *[49:04]*: Test what has been built already or just walk through the user flow? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[49:10]*: Yeah, so I can host the link. Let me see about getting that up and running. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[49:14]*: I've had some issues with DigitalOcean recently, but let me look into that and. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[49:19]*: If I can get that up tonight. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[49:20]*: I'll shoot you a message about it. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[49:21]*: Just so you can play around with it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[49:23]*: Okay. Yeah, I'm really excited and I'm thinking possibly I'm just going to move that to maybe to a different domain. I think it's going to better that way because now I'm seeing like this Cargo credible. I wouldn't want it to stop. We don't know when it's going to be ready or whatever like that. Maybe we should just. Yeah, I'm just thinking of moving it to like a totally different domain, just one standalone domain. This is what it does. It's a price calculator. It's direct. It's just one thing. It offers just one thing. We can just put like powered by. 
**Azeez Ali** *[49:56]*: Cargo credible and that's it. 
**Azeez Ali** *[49:57]*: But it offers just one thing and that's like calculating freights, making sure you. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:02]*: Get the right amount and every other. 
**Azeez Ali** *[50:04]*: Thing like that for sure. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:06]*: Got it. Look, I have my marching orders, I have Leonardo here to help me out. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:10]*: And you know, all of our developers. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:12]*: That we have between the two of us here. So again, number one priority on my list here, making sure that we're all set and rounded out and getting Cargo. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:20]*: Credible back up and running appropriately. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:23]*: But again, I Appreciate your time today. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:25]*: Thank you for the explanations with everything. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:27]*: And yeah, we're gonna get to work. 
**Azeez Ali** *[50:30]*: Okay, thank you very much. So should I be expecting that link tonight, the one for the great calculator? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:38]*: Yep. 
**Azeez Ali** *[50:39]*: Okay. And if I'm going to do like a new domain and we're not going to use Cargo Credible, what are the things you're going to need of me to do? Like because there's going to be emails, there's going to be all this stuff. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:54]*: Yeah. So GoDaddy is probably your best bet. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:55]*: In terms of setting up domains. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[50:58]*: That's usually where I go through if. 
**Azeez Ali** *[51:00]*: I'm setting up a domain. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:01]*: And then if you're able to share that kind of share that domain with me. I don't know if they let you. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:08]*: Kind of invite people to your account. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:09]*: Or not, but if you're able to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:11]*: I can kind of go in there. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:12]*: And configure things appropriately. 
**Azeez Ali** *[51:14]*: Okay. 
**Azeez Ali** *[51:15]*: And then what about the. Definitely there's going to be some sort of like email sequence whenever people log in. Password, forget password, all the stuff like how we start going to work is it going to, you can either use. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:30]*: You can keep using sendgrid if you. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:32]*: Want to, or if you want to use mailjet. Mailjet's pretty good. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:35]*: So we just have to hook up. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[51:36]*: An external email API provider and that'll be all said and done for you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[51:41]*: Okay. Even I'm going to treat this like a separate project, not even putting it to Cargo Credible. Later we might link it, but right now I just want to like, let's just take it like a separate project. Right. If we're going to do that, like, is there a way you can give. 
**Azeez Ali** *[51:56]*: Me like a list of the things. 
**Azeez Ali** *[51:57]*: You want me to do so I can get on those like ASAP and just get it out there, you know, so that we can square up. Let's say, for example, the domain. What else do you need? You need the, let's say the email to be set up. What else do you need? 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:12]*: Yeah, I'll send you a list. There's probably seven different third party providers that I'll let off the list for you. But yeah, that'd certainly be good to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:20]*: Set up those accounts as soon. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:22]*: As you're able to. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:23]*: And I'll make sure I get. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:23]*: The list over to you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[52:25]*: Okay, that sounds good. And the thing I wanted to ask about is you did mention like the APIs. I know some of them are like free, should I say most of them? Is there anyone that has to be paid. Maybe PCMiler, maybe tollguru. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:40]*: There are a few of them that do have to be paid. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:42]*: Yeah, I'll be sure to note that too. And I'll send over some estimated. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[52:46]*: Estimated cost for you in terms of monthly maintenance. 
**Azeez Ali** *[52:51]*: Okay. And also like we did mention about the weather, the distance, the. The. What is it called, the fuel that we're getting, but we didn't mention about. 
**Azeez Ali** *[53:04]*: The altitude because altitude also affects. 
**Azeez Ali** *[53:06]*: Where are we going to be getting the altitudes from. Yep. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[53:10]*: I think we have a service in here. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[53:11]*: Let me double check. I'm fairly certain I implemented a service. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[53:15]*: For that, but I will confirm that with you and if not, then that would be a super easy implementation. Okay, I'm pretty sure, actually, I'm fairly certain. I'm fairly certain PC Mylar tracks altitude. 
**Azeez Ali** *[53:28]*: I'll double check. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[53:29]*: So I'm not 100% sure. 
**Azeez Ali** *[53:31]*: Okay. In that case, I'm just going to keep working on the data. Those guys are like a little bit slow. And once we have the data all set up, then I'm going to send that information to you or where we. 
**Azeez Ali** *[53:47]*: Can get all the load data, the historical data. 
**Azeez Ali** *[53:51]*: So it's going to help calculate and show us what the historical data is like and. Yeah, then we should be good to go. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[53:58]*: Sounds good to me. 
**Azeez Ali** *[54:02]*: All right, cool. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[54:02]*: All right, I appreciate your time again. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[54:04]*: And yeah, I'll be sure to reach. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[54:06]*: Out with some more information for you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[54:08]*: Okay, sounds good. Thank you very much. Jacob. Nice to meet you. Lauren. Leonardo. 
**Jacob Haqq** *[54:13]*: Thank you. 
**Azeez Ali** *[54:13]*: Nice to meet you. Yeah, thank you so much. All right, goodbye.
